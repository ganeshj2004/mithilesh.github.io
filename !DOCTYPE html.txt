        <h1>Criminal Justice Reform</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Ending Mass Incarceration</h2>
            <p>One major focus of criminal justice reform is reducing the high rates of incarceration, particularly for nonviolent offenses. This involves advocating for alternatives to incarceration such as rehabilitation programs, community service, and probation, as well as reevaluating sentencing laws and practices that contribute to over-incarceration.</p>

        <!-- Police Reform -->
        <section>
            <h2>Police Reform</h2>
            <p>There are calls for reforming police practices to address issues such as racial profiling, excessive use of force, and lack of accountability. This includes implementing de-escalation training, promoting community policing strategies, and establishing independent oversight mechanisms to hold law enforcement accountable for misconduct.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Bail Reform -->
        <section>
            <h2>Bail Reform</h2>
            <p>Bail systems have been criticized for disproportionately affecting low-income individuals who are unable to afford bail, leading to pretrial detention solely because of financial constraints. Bail reform aims to create fairer systems that prioritize public safety while ensuring that individuals are not detained simply because they cannot afford bail.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Addressing Racial Disparities -->
        <section>
            <h2>Addressing Racial Disparities</h2>
            <p>Racial disparities pervade every aspect of the criminal justice system, from policing to sentencing to incarceration. Criminal justice reform efforts seek to address these disparities by examining and challenging systemic biases, promoting racial equity in all stages of the justice process, and advocating for policies that reduce the disproportionate impact of the criminal justice system on communities of color.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Rehabilitation and Reentry -->
        <section>
            <h2>Rehabilitation and Reentry</h2>
            <p>Rather than focusing solely on punishment, criminal justice reform emphasizes rehabilitation and successful reentry into society for individuals who have been incarcerated. This involves providing access to education, job training, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and other support services to help individuals reintegrate into their communities and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Ending the War on Drugs -->
        <section>
            <h2>Ending the War on Drugs</h2>
            <p>The "War on Drugs" has been criticized for its role in fueling mass incarceration, perpetuating racial disparities, and prioritizing punitive measures over public health approaches. Criminal justice reform advocates for ending punitive drug policies, treating substance abuse as a public health issue rather than a criminal one, and investing in prevention, treatment, and harm reduction strategies.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Juvenile Justice Reform -->
        <section>
            <h2>Juvenile Justice Reform</h2>
            <p>The juvenile justice system also faces significant challenges, including harsh sentencing practices, racial disparities, and inadequate support for rehabilitation and reintegration. Juvenile justice reform aims to prioritize rehabilitation over punishment, promote diversion programs for nonviolent youth offenders, and ensure that juvenile justice systems are fair, equitable, and developmentally appropriate.</p>
